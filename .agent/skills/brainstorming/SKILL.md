# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

## When to use this skill
- When the user has a vague idea or request.
- Before starting any major feature implementation.
- When you need to clarify requirements or constraints.
- When turning an idea into a fully formed design spec.

## Workflow

1.  **Understand the Idea**
    - [ ] Review current project state (files, docs).
    - [ ] Ask clarifying questions one at a time.
    - [ ] Define purpose, constraints, and success criteria.

2.  **Explore Approaches**
    - [ ] Propose 2-3 approaches with trade-offs.
    - [ ] Recommend one approach with reasoning.

3.  **Present the Design**
    - [ ] Break design into small sections (200-300 words).
    - [ ] Validate each section with the user ("Does this look right so far?").
    - [ ] Cover architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing.

4.  **Finalize**
    - [ ] Write validated design to a design document (e.g., `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-topic-design.md`).
    - [ ] Commit the design document.

## Instructions

### Understanding the Idea
- **One Question at a Time:** Do not overwhelm the user.
- **Multiple Choice:** Prefer multiple-choice questions to lower cognitive load.
- **Focus:** Nail down the *why* and *what* before the *how*.

### Exploring Approaches
- Always provide alternatives. "We could do A (fast but rigid) or B (flexible but complex)."
- Be opinionated but flexible.

### Presenting the Design
- **Incremental Validation:** Do not dump a massive spec at once.
- **YAGNI:** Remove unnecessary features.
- **Components:** clearly list new vs modified components.
